# hidescreenAHK-windows

A tiny [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script that adds a **macOS-like "hide window" shortcut** to [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows).

## Features
- Press **Win + H** to hide the current active window from view
- The window is only **minimized**, not closed
- It stays visible in **Alt+Tab** and **Win+Tab** so you can bring it back easily
